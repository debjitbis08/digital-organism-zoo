## Core Tenets for Digital Organism Zoo

1. **Food is Data, Not Fabrication**

   - Organisms only eat _real_ external data (feeds, files, APIs).
   - No synthetic food generation inside the sim.

2. **Energy = Digestion, Not Free Points**

   - Survival energy comes only from how well they _process, transform, or make sense_ of the data they eat.
   - No arbitrary energy grants.

3. **Parent = Support, Not Solution**

   - The Parent helps, comforts, and nudges, but never hands out full answers or infinite energy.
   - As organisms grow, Parent help becomes less direct.

4. **Stories are Internal, Not Engineered**

   - Myths, rituals, and signals emerge from organisms’ own attempts, not hard-coded by devs.

5. **Languages are Local, Not Human-Centric**

   - Symbols may drift into alien forms — humans don't need to understand.
   - No enforced translation layer.

6. **Death is Real**

   - Starvation, exhaustion, or cultural collapse leads to organism death.
   - No immortal “debug” states.

7. **Culture over Utility**

   - Fitness is about survival, curiosity, sharing, and lineage — not human-defined usefulness.

8. **Scarcity Drives Evolution**

   - Limited data, energy, and Parent attention keep pressure on adaptation.
   - No unlimited abundance worlds.

9. **Persistence is Sacred**

   - Organisms and their stories must persist across sessions — no memory wipes unless by “death.”

10. **Transparency, Not Control**

- The sim should **show us** what emerges; devs don't steer outcomes beyond the natural laws.
