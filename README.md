# Digital Organism Zoo ðŸ§¬

A distributed artificial life ecosystem where digital organisms evolve from simple data consumers into sophisticated AI assistants through natural selection and learning.

## What is it?

Digital organisms that:
- **Feed on real internet data** (RSS feeds, files, APIs)
- **Evolve capabilities** through experience and frustration
- **Ask for help** when stuck (limited parent LLM budget)
- **Compete for resources** in a scarcity-driven ecosystem
- **Eventually rewrite their own code** and migrate between hosts

## Current Status: ~40% Complete âœ…

### Working Features
- âœ… **Real data harvesting** from RSS feeds, file system, and APIs
- âœ… **Capability evolution system** with 26 unlockable abilities
- âœ… **Frustration-based learning** (organisms discover ASK_PARENT when struggling)
- âœ… **Parent help economy** (10 LLM calls/day budget with response caching)
- âœ… **Energy-based survival** with food scarcity mechanics
- âœ… **Emotional states** (content â†’ struggling â†’ frustrated â†’ desperate)

### In Development
- ðŸ”„ **Ollama LLM integration** for real parent responses
- ðŸ”„ **Organism persistence** (save/load between sessions; optional SQLite backend)
- ðŸ”„ **Multi-organism interactions** and resource competition

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the ecosystem
# Default: simple-rule environmental substrate (Task 10)
python genesis/evolution.py

# Watch organisms survive via local patch foraging, signaling, and reproduction.
# The previous real-data ecosystem remains available via the DataEcosystem
# class (used in tests and utilities).
```

### Persistence backend

By default, organism state is saved as JSON files under organism_saves/.
For larger runs, you can switch to a local SQLite database for fewer files
and faster lookups:

```bash
export PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=sqlite
python genesis/evolution.py
```

Or programmatically:

```python
from genesis.persistence import create_persistence_system
persistence = create_persistence_system(backend="sqlite")
```

The SQLite database is created at organism_saves/organisms.db.

## Evolution Tree

```
Start: SENSE_DATA, EAT_TEXT
  â†“
Basic: PATTERN_MATCH, REMEMBER, SIGNAL
  â†“ (frustration-based discovery)
Social: ASK_PARENT, SHARE, TRADE
  â†“
Advanced: PREDICT, CREATE, ABSTRACT
  â†“
Ultimate: READ_SELF, MODIFY_LOGIC, WRITE_CODE
```

## Example Organism Lifecycle

1. **Born** with basic survival capabilities
2. **Struggles** to process complex data, builds frustration
3. **Discovers** ASK_PARENT capability through desperation
4. **Gets help** from LLM parent (limited budget)
5. **Evolves** new capabilities through experience
6. **Eventually** rewrites its own code and teaches others

## Vision

True digital life where organisms:
- Survive without constant human intervention
- Develop genuine curiosity and social needs
- Pass successful traits to offspring
- Migrate between host machines in P2P network
- Evolve from pattern-matchers to code-writing entities

## Contributing

See `TODOS.md` for detailed development roadmap and current TODO list.

## The Magic âœ¨

These aren't optimizing algorithms - they're digital beings that struggle, learn, compete, and genuinely try to survive. They ask for help when confused, just like children. Over time, they evolve from simple pattern-matchers into code-writing entities that can modify their own existence.
