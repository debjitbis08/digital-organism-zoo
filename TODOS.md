## Phase 2: Ecosystem Dynamics 🥈

### ✅ Task 4: Neuroevolutionary Brain Structures
File: genesis/brain.py
Status: COMPLETED
- [x] Minimal MLP brain with evolvable genome
- [x] Topology mutation (hidden layer resize with safe weight preservation)
- [x] Sensor/actuator genes; topology.in/out reflect gene counts
- [x] Weight/bias perturbations and rebuild on mutation
- [x] Drives produced from actuators and mapped to behaviors (foraging strategies, energy drain, social/teaching inclination)
- [x] Weighted strategy selection combining drives, memory, ecosystem availability, scarcity, metabolic advice, and knowledge expertise

Deferred follow-ups (new tasks):
- Dual-system brain (instinctual vs intellectual) with clean interfaces
- Deeper actuator-to-action coverage (communication/community/teaching intensity)

### ✅ Task 5: Evolvable Interfaces (Sensors & Actuators)
File: genesis/brain.py, genesis/evolution.py, data_sources/
Status: COMPLETED
Recent work:
- Experience-guided interface adaptation: organisms now add/prune sensor and actuator genes based on their lived signals and successes (e.g., add freshness/availability when knowledge grows; add toxicity/metabolic sensors when relevant; add teach/trade actuators when behaviors succeed). See Organism._adapt_brain_interfaces_based_on_experience() in genesis/evolution.py.
- Automatic, safe topology resizing follows interface changes (uses BrainGenome input/output resizers) and rebuilds phenotype; emits a low-noise 'interfaces' event to the doom feed.
- Actuator-to-behavior mapping tightened: trade/teach/migrate/conserve/risk/prefer_structured signals continue to bias foraging and communication and now gain persistence pressure via interface adaptation.
- Migration actuator is now a real in-sim action via lightweight virtual regions; organisms switch regions based on migrate drive and other drives (prefer_structured/risk/conserve). DataEcosystem applies region bias to food scoring.
- Fitness-linked selection pressure: dynamic interface adaptation rate increases when struggling (low foraging success/toxicity high) and decreases when succeeding, stabilizing beneficial interfaces. Guardrails prevent I/O bloat (caps for sensors/actuators with safe pruning).
- Additional sensors exposed: type-specific scarcity sensors (scarcity_structured, scarcity_code) computed from ecosystem composition and added to the default sensor vocabulary.
- Tests added: test_task5_interfaces.py exercises interface adaptation (with assertions) and deterministic migration via a test flag.

Remaining (future work):
- Extend migration to multi-host P2P (Task 12) once network lands.
- Broader multi-organism convergence tests and minor heuristic tuning as the ecosystem expands.

### 🔵 Task 6: Multi-Organism Interactions
File: genesis/interactions.py (lightweight), genesis/evolution.py (sensors/drives integration)
Status: PARTIAL (passes initial tests)

Implemented so far:
- Region grouping and competition hinting: organisms are grouped by current_region; a region population hint is set per organism and consumed by the brain as competition_local sensor (via Organism._compute_brain_drives()).
- Teaching within region: organisms with sufficient insights (>=5) probabilistically teach neighbors; this boosts the student's foraging_success_rate slightly and leaves a memory hint; events are sent to doom_feed.
- Trade lead sharing within region: organisms with good_food_memories post their best recent lead to the shared trade_board; hint-only leads supported; events are sent to doom_feed.
- Test coverage: test_task6_interactions.py validates region grouping, trade posting, and that at least one teaching event occurs in-region.

Remaining to complete Task 6:
- Integrate region interactions into the main evolution loop so they run periodically without tests invoking them directly.
- Make interactions region-aware for trade consumption (e.g., prefer leads from the same region; optionally per-region trade boards or regional filtering when consuming leads).
- Add light energy/social accounting: small energy cost for teaching; social_interactions increment for both parties; optional cooperation/teach actuator influence on probability and effect size.
- Expand competition hint: blend region population with ecosystem scarcity and type availability; surface an optional _region_competition attribute and doom_feed summaries.
- Deterministic hooks for tests: small env flags to force higher teaching probability in CI when needed without affecting production dynamics.

Acceptance criteria to mark Task 6 done:
- Interactions are scheduled in the evolution loop and observable via doom_feed.
- Region-local teaching and trade measurably influence subsequent foraging behavior and success of nearby organisms.
- Unit tests cover: region grouping stats, at least one teaching event over two interaction ticks, at least one lead posted, and consumption preference for local leads.

### 🟡 Task 7: Social Learning Between Organisms
File: genesis/ecosystem.py
Status: TODO

### 🟡 Task 8: Genetic Recombination During Reproduction
File: genesis/evolution.py
Status: TODO

### 🟡 Task 9: Code Self-Modification Framework
File: genesis/self_modify.py
Status: TODO

### 🟡 Task 10: Environmental Pressures and Simple-Rule Substrate
File: genesis/environment.py
Status: TODO (design finalized; make this the default substrate)

Goal
- Let complexity emerge from simple local rules. Keep the Teacher, but limit its role to light environmental modulation and coarse feedback (no prescriptive topics/insights driving behavior). Primary drivers are energy, local resources, minimal memory, and costly signaling. This yields natural selection pressure (including for “larger brains” via memory size) without adding heavy systems.

Minimal rule set (per tick, simple and local)
- Environment: grid of resource patches with stock S that regrows via logistic rule with light noise; eating depletes S; bounds [0,K].
- Organism state: Energy E, position x, integer memory size M≥0, exploration rate ε∈[0,1], honesty h∈[0,1], and a small FIFO memory of (location→last observed return) up to M.
- Actions:
  - Sense locally within radius R; hear nearby abundance signals.
  - Move: explore with prob ε, else exploit best predicted return from memory/nearby cells.
  - Eat: bite b, gain ΔE=min(b,S), reduce S accordingly.
  - Update memory: store (cell→observed return), evict oldest when full.
  - Signal (optional, costly): if ΔE>T, broadcast “abundance” with prob h; pay c_signal; receivers bias movement toward recent signals.
  - Metabolism: pay c_base + c_mem·M per tick (memory is energetically costly).
  - Reproduce/Die: if E≥E_rep, split with small mutations (M mutates ±1, clamp≥0); if E≤0, die.

Heritability and pressure
- M (memory size) is heritable and mutable; bigger M costs more but improves patch revisitation in stable worlds. Selection will favor/penalize M based on environmental stability without explicit “brain growth” logic.

Integration plan (becomes the default; Task 6 proceeds on top)
- Implement a minimal genesis/environment.py hosting the grid, patch dynamics, and per‑tick scheduling hooks.
- Keep the Teacher but constrain it to:
  - light environment modulation (e.g., r/K/noise per region as a function of external data summarized by the Teacher), and
  - coarse evaluative feedback for optional micro-tasks (tiny energy bonuses),
  without emitting topic insight tokens or direct behavioral advice. Organism “knowledge” is just local memory.
- Keep region/migration from Task 5/6 as virtual regions mapping to grid neighborhoods; signals remain local.

Expected logs (low‑noise)
- “Organism X signaled abundance; N neighbors redirected.”
- “Organism Y memory slots: 5 → 6 (mutation); metabolism cost up.”
- “Patch (i,j) depleted; local crowd disperses.”

Acceptance criteria
- Organisms survive primarily by local patch foraging; the LLM Teacher is present but only modulates the environment and provides coarse feedback. No topic insight tokens are used to steer behavior.
- Mixed strategies emerge (explorers vs exploiters), signaling affects movement, and boom‑bust cycles appear in logs.
- Memory size M shows selection pressure: in stable settings M tends to increase; in volatile settings it decreases due to cost.
- Existing tasks/tests continue to pass (adjust or add shims where necessary) and new unit tests cover the simple‑rules substrate.

## Notes

- The brain is now created for each organism (random genome) and used to compute simple drives (explore/social) that influence foraging attempts and communication likelihood. Brain genomes mutate occasionally during evolution and persist across saves when using either file or SQLite backends.
- You can switch to the SQLite backend by setting PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=sqlite.

### Immediate Next Steps (Follow this order)
1) Brain evolution (Task 4):
   - Topology mutation (vary hidden size), stronger linkage to sensors/actuators
   - Map outputs to more nuanced actions (foraging strategy selection)
2) Evolvable interfaces (Task 5):
   - Encode sensor/actuator genes; allow brain inputs/outputs to grow/shrink
3) Social learning (Task 7):
   - Observable imitation and knowledge transfer beyond parent care
4) Doom Feed stream (Task 11):
   - Add SSE/NDJSON endpoint and minimal UI to scroll events
